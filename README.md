# Machine Learning Practical

This is the second coursework of the Machine Learning Practical Course. The aim of this coursework is to explore classification of images using CNNs (Convolutional Neural Networks). First, we have to visualize the problem of vanishing gradient on VGG38 neural network. Then we have to implement two methods which help with the problem of vanishing gradient- batch normalization and Residual Connections. 

After implementing them, I experiment on different parameters and combination of the two aforementioned methods and also learning rate and weight decay in order to find out which combination works the best. The project was written on Pytorch and uses popular frameworks like Numpy and Matplotlib. Report.pdf outlines the experiments and the analysis of the results.
